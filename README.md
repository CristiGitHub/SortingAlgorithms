# SortingAlgorithms

# En:
# This is a simple Java Program that implements some Sorting Algorithms such as HeapSort, QuickSort , InsertionSort , MergSort , BullbeSort ,RadixSort ,CountSort  ,SelectionSort and BubbleSort . Also in the future i will try to add TeamSort and IntroSort . The program prints every time of each sorting algorithm and cheacks if the array was sorted correctly .
# Also the program has an Array generator fuction which can generate Pre-Sorted Arrays, Almost-Sortted Arrays, Random Generated Arrays , Mountain shaped Arrays ( 1, 3 ,5 ,7 ,9 ,5,3,2,) and Perlin Noise Generated Arrays with some Mathematical tweks
#  In input.txt on the first row is the number of tests nad than on each line the first number is the number of elemnts in the array , the second one is the maximum value of an element from the array and the last one is the type of generation for each array ( sorted, random , almostSorted , InterstingGenAlg, Mountain);
# PS: WIKIPEDIA reprisented a good inspiration for the Perlin Noise Generator ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) I liked the concept of this kind of generation in the future i would like to improve my version of Perlin
# PSx2: If you find a bug don't hesitate to pacth it :D
